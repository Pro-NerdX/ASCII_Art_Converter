# Interface

When running the application, the program asks you to select a file. This must be a file of an allowed type (see below). After successfully selecting a file, it'll ask you then to select a place and a name to save the generated ascii-art as a `.txt` file.

## Tested File Types
- `.png`
- `.jpg`
